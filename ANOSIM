## Load the library
library(vegan)

## Import data table containing species abundances.
my_species = read.table("Species.csv", header=T, row.names=1, sep=",")

## Import data table containing environmental variables of samples included in "my_species"
my_variables = read.table("Env_variables.csv", header=T, row.names=1, sep=",")

## Calculate ANOSIM analysis on main table using additional categorical environmental variables
result = with(my_variables, anosim(vegdist(my_species, method="bray"), grouping=Env_variable4))

## See the result statistics and plot
summary(result)
plot(result)

## Reading result
# An R value close to "1.0" suggests dissimilarity between groups while an R value close to "0" suggests an even distribution of high and low ranks within and between groups. R values below "0" suggest that dissimilarities are greater within groups than between groups.
