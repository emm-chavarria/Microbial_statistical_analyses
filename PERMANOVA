## Import data table containing species abundances
my_species = read.table("Species.csv", header=T, row.names=1, sep=",")

## Import data table containing environmental variables of samples included in "my_species"
my_variables = read.table("Env_variables.csv", header=T, row.names=1, sep=",")

## Load vegan package
library(vegan)
adonis(my_species ~ Env_variable1 + Env_variable2 * Env_variable3, data=my_variables, permutations=999)

## NOTE 1
# adonis performs PERMANOVA tests in such a way that "Terms added sequentially (first to last)" which means that THE ORDER OF THE VARIABLES MATTERS when defining the result.

## NOTE 2
# Variables separated by "+" are evaluated independently while variables with "*" are dependent to each other for the test, this while respecting the order of the variables (See note 1).

## Reading result
# It is generally accepted that any separation between groups is NOT SIGNIFICANTÂ if Pr(>F) > 0.05).
